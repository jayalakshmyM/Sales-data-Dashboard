📖 Sales Performance Dashboard – A visual Storytelling from May 2022 (FY 22-23)

📅 It’s May 2022, and we’re diving into the sales performance for the financial year 2022–23. The dashboard paints a detailed picture of how the business is doing across various cities, stores, and product lines.

💰 We kicked off the month with ₹2.68 Lakhs in total sales. So far this year, we’ve brought in ₹5.26 Lakhs — but when we look back at the same point last year, we were already at ₹5.82 Lakhs. A clear sign that we’re trailing behind.

🔁 Even our Month-to-Date (MTD) Sales at ₹2.68 Lakhs didn’t quite match up to last year's ₹2.99 Lakhs, suggesting a slowdown in May’s momentum.

🧸 Toys continue to be our top-selling category — leading the charge with massive figures and steady growth. Following closely are Art & Crafts, Sports & Outdoors, Games, and Electronics.

🧱 When we zoom into product-level data, Lego Bricks clearly dominate the revenue charts, raking in over ₹2.23 Lakhs, far ahead of the next best sellers — Action Figures, Dino Eggs, and others.

📍 On the location front, Downtown is the star performer with more than ₹1.5 Lakhs in sales, followed by Monterrey and Ciudad Victoria. These cities are helping keep overall numbers strong.

📉 However, not all locations are celebrating. Several cities show negative growth compared to last year. This includes Guadalajara, San Luis Potosi, and Puebla, all signaling areas where we may need to dig deeper and take corrective action.

📊 Visually, the dashboard offers:

🧭 With powerful filters (product, city, store, category), users can interactively explore the data and uncover more detailed insights, tailored to their needs.

🧠 The takeaway? While we have strong product champions and high-performing locations, our overall sales growth is lagging behind last year, and certain stores need focused strategies to regain momentum.
